The full schema and\n                semantics from the original CO-Bench task description below:\n\n        Solves the crew scheduling problem.\n\nThe problem consists of assigning each task (with a defined start and finish time) to exactly one crew,\nsuch that:\n  - The tasks within each crew are executed in non-overlapping order.\n  - For every consecutive pair of tasks in a crew’s schedule, a valid transition arc exists (with an associated cost).\n  - The overall duty time (finish time of the last task minus start time of the first task) does not exceed the specified time limit.\n  - Exactly K crews are used.\n\nInput kwargs (for one case):\n  - N (int): Number of tasks.\n  - K (int): Maximum number of crews to be used.\n  - time_limit (float): Maximum allowed duty time.\n  - tasks (dict): Dictionary mapping task ID (1 to N) to a tuple (start_time, finish_time).\n  - arcs (dict): Dictionary mapping (from_task, to_task) pairs to transition cost.\n\nEvaluation metric:\n  - If all constraints are met (no task overlap, valid transition arcs, duty time within the limit, and exactly K crews used), the score is the sum of transition costs across all crews.\n  - If any constraint is violated, the solution is infeasible and receives no score.\n  - A lower score indicates a more cost-effective solution.\n\nReturns:\n  dict: A dictionary with one key "crews", whose value is a list of lists. Each inner list is a sequence of task IDs (integers)\n        representing one crew’s schedule.\n\n      tools:        see the "Available tools" section above.\n      time_limit_s: max wall-clock seconds (self-monitor with time.time()).\n\n    Returns:\n      The solution dict in the shape the task expects.
